# DevToolSwitcher
A CLI tool for opening coding projects quickly.


## Vulnerabilities
I believe there is a known vulnerability in a dependency for the JDBC package, but I need to do further research on this.

## Setup
Install SQLite and run the queries in DB/SQL to set it up. Clone the project, make sure you have org.xenial.sqlite-jdbc installed, and run the project.
